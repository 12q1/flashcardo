# flashcardo

Flash Cardo is the result of a small group project I did during one of my first days learning about HTML/CSS/Javascript.

You can see a live version at https://12q1.github.io/flashcardo/

It is by no means a finished product but I do plan to expand on this project by rewriting it in react in the future.

For now it remains as a reminder of the progress I've made.
